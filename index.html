  <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <br>
        <p id=background>I was born and raised in Arlington Washington. I attended school at the Lakewood School District from 7th to 12th grade, and before that I attended Grace Academy in Marysville. I have always had the bug for adventure, which drew me into a love for hiking and backpacking. I spent most of my free days in highschool hiking and backpacking with my friends all over Washington! When it was time to decide on where I wanted to go for college, I made the decision to move to Arizona and explore new terrains!</p>
